The Coyote Library is an Open Source programming project, hosted at
https://github.com/davidwfanning/idl-coyote.

Programs in the Coyote Library are updated frequently and new
programs are added continuously. It is extremely important that
you keep up with recent changes if you expect to work with the
Coyote Library and all of the other IDL programs in the world that
use the Coyote Library. Please update your library every time
you think of it! 

You can find the latest version of the Coyote Library here:

Or, in the Download section here:

The Coyote Library evolved from work David Fanning was doing
teaching IDL courses and answering IDL questions on the IDL
newsgroup. It is meant to be a well-documented library that
demonstrates how to write solid (dare we say eloquent) IDL
programs that are easy to maintain and extend. You can learn
more about these programs and about IDL programming in general
at David's web page, Coyote's Guide to IDL Programming.

PROGRAMS RENAMED:

Note that in February 2011 a great many Coyote Library programs
were renamed to start with the letter "cg" for Coyote Graphics.
The old programs didn't go away, they simply moved to the "retired"
sub-directory in the Coyote Library. If you want to use them, all
you need to is add the Coyote Library and all its sub-directories to
your IDL path. (Normally this is done by putting a check mark in 
front of the directory if you set your path with the IDL workbench,
or by adding a + sign to the name of the directory in an IDL start-up
file.)

Further development, however, had stopped for "retired" programs
and will only go forward on the renamed Coyote Library programs.
This means you will *probably* want to start using the new names
in your programs. Most of the names are self-explanatory. A few
are not. Here are some common programs with their name changes on
the right:

   CTLoad -> cgLoadCT
   FSC_Color -> cgColor
   LoadData -> cgDemoData
   TVInfo -> cgImageInfo
   TVImage -> cgImage
   TVRead -> cgSnapshot
